    "Competition is a problem that most organisms have to face. Whether the competitor is a conspecific (of the same species) or it is another organism alltogether (interspecific), most organisms typically are part of multiple competitive relationships at any given time. Competition essentially means that one or more entities desire access to the same resource. Examples of such resources are food, sunlight, territory, mates, and water. Different animals which hunt the same prey are often in competition with eachother. Similarly, animals of the same species which eat a specific plant may be in competition if the access to the plant is limited.\n",

    "In the following exercises we will imagine a conceptually plausible scenario which may occur out in the real world. We imagine there to be a population of birds living close to a certain tree which produces berries. The berries form from pollinated flowers, and gradually develop into ripe fruit (berries are a type of fruit). The nutrional value of the berries is higher when the berries have ripened, but there is still a significant amount of calories to be had from eating an unripened berry. We will consider only the situations in which two birds discover the same berry at the same time. The birds have two options:\n",
    "\n",
    "1 - Attempt to eat the berry\n",
    "\n",
    "2 - Leave the berry to ripen\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 4 possible outcomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1 - Bird 1 eats, Bird 2 eats\n",
    "\n",
    "2 - Bird 1 eats, Bird 2 leaves\n",
    "\n",
    "3 - Bird 1 leaves, Bird 2 eats\n",
    "\n",
    "4 - Bird 1 leaves, Bird 2 leaves\n",
    "\n",
    "Eating a developing berry yields 30 calories right there and then. In outcomes 2 and 3, one of the birds eats the entire unripe berry. Leaving the berry yields 20 calories only if both birds leave. This is because leaving the berry to ripen will allow it to become more nutritious, and both birds may eat their share at a later point in time. If both birds attempt to eat the berry, it results in 10 calories for each bird, as the struggle over the food cause some of the 30 calories to be lost. As a general rule, a bird will seek to maximize its calory gain throughout life as this improves chances of survival of itself and its offspring.\n",

Playing 100 rounds takes time, even though the machine responds instantaneously. Why not do what the machine does?

    "Returning to our hypothetical birds, we can assume that over a season of looking for berries, the birds are likely to run into each other frequently. This means that during the season, many interactions of the kinds we have just seen must occur for any given bird in the population. In order to make a simulation of this, we need to iterate the scenario above for all strategies, having each one face all the ones until they have all interacted. For the sake of simplicity, we will allow all strategies to face all other strategies. This can be done by adding a few extra lines of code, wrapping a couple of loops around the code we have been using so far."
